The purpose of this version is to demonstarate how to invoke a C executable (binary) kept at the backend server. Note that this version is same as [this](https://github.com/SMaityCodes/WebSiteWithBackEnd/tree/Veriosn2) except the extra file `my_c_program` whcih is a binary executabe generated by compiling a C program. Also, the code inside `server.js` is now different - as it is now invoking the binary executable (just have a look into the code). The source code of the C program is also uploaded in this repositor , however; the repo. can be deployed (in local machine or on the web) without the source code also.

## How to test it on local machine:-
### Prerequisite 
- Nodejs : for server-side scripting, supporting requirement for ganache etc.
- VSCode : editor for solidity etc.
- LiveServer : for hosting web-server

### Testing Steps
Same as this: [
"WebSiteWithBackEnd"
 version2 branch](https://github.com/SMaityCodes/WebSiteWithBackEnd/tree/Veriosn2)

## Deployment Guidelines:-

Same as this: ["WebSiteWithBackEnd" main branch](https://github.com/SMaityCodes/WebSiteWithBackEnd.git)
